[X] no local var should start with x
[X] opcode syntax aint assignment
[X] Opcode tuple from FLOSS string
[X] Opcode expansion (~= overloads)
[X] use FLOSS to generate local variable names
[X] terminal consts should not be a set of predetermined, fixed values
[X] term ratio on tree generation doesn't make much sense anymore
[X] neither does the terminal set
[X] Elt is misleading, you actually have Opcode (Operator | Opcode) and constant (generators as they come with a type converter)
[X] introduce arg ranges, ex (picking a function, int set) or (set amp, you want dbs) 
[X] base arg range on var name
[X] add arg range to FLOSS and use it
[ ] implement checks to limit the impact on syntax errors in csound reference
[X] ditch operators?
[ ] freq: sample custom distribution using a rejection method

<= above point are to be documented

# type conversion
http://floss.booktype.pro/csound/overview/


# nomenclature, var prefixes
https://csound.com/docs/manual/OrchNomen.html

# to compute spectrograms
# https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.spectrogram.html

# how these spectrograms are to be compared?
# spectrograms will be 2 matrices of the same size, so a diff? squared diff?
# start simple plz

Note trailing underscores to prevent name collisions (range, type)

we did not include opcodes that have multiple outputs

note use rejection sampling

computing the similarity of 2 sounds

TODO
osc need function tables, we will use a convention here

beware of CSound doc, it may lag behind,
when a program doesn't compile, go run it directly in CSound

prevent an individual from taking over by being cloned
